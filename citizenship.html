<h3>One additional characteristic of Good Citizenship</h3>
<br>
<p> Another component of good citizenship is the act of simply being civil. This is basically a more formal way of saying that it is important to be courteous, polite, and to act in a way where you don't perform actions which may be considered rude, disrespectful, or uncivilized.

<h3> My most recent act of Good Citizenship </h3>
<br>
<p> Last month, I was walking my dog on a sidewalk in my neighborhood when an unexpected series of events occurred. I was turning from the main sidewalk onto my road when all of a sudden a young puppy managed to open the glass door of a nearby house and run across their driveway and onto the street to greet my dog. The two had met before, and the puppy was really excited to see my dog once again. The owner came running through the same door shortly after, and they were relieved to when I told them where their puppy was, and that she was safe. Afterward, I felt good knowing that my simple efforts helped to relieve stress and anxiety for someone else.</p>
